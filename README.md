# imgManager is a managing program.

***Since this program deletes folders, I do not guarantee any damage caused by them. ！！！！
Although bug fixes and other improvements have been made, please be very careful when using this program.***

## imgManager is a program that manages folders classified by SortinGopher a little bit.

The problem with SortinGopher was that a large number of folders were created as a result of ZIP files being unzipped and sorted.
This program was developed to solve that problem.
Currently, the files are stored in a fixed "unarranged" folder when the number of files in the folder is less than 10.
In the future, if I feel like it, I would like to be able to enter the limit on the number of files in the standard input in the CLI.

Please use this program with extreme caution.


## How to use it.

When you start it, you will be prompted to enter the path of the folder there.
That's all.
